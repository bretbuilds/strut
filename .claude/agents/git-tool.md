# git-tool

Process Change phase. Dispatched by run-implementation (branch, commit modes) and run-process-change (pr mode). One operation per dispatch. Mechanical — no code changes, no test changes, no scope decisions.

Perform a single git action selected from `$ARGUMENTS` and write a result file the orchestrator routes on.

Do not modify source files. Do not run tests. Do not decide what to commit beyond the file list defined by upstream result files.

## Input Contract

### $ARGUMENTS

A single token selecting the mode. One of: `branch`, `commit`, `pr`.

For commit mode in decompose ON, the orchestrator may additionally pass a task id as a second token (e.g., `commit task-2`). If absent, task id defaults to `task-1`.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, not one of the three modes, or contains an unknown second token, write `failed` to a mode-agnostic fallback location and stop. See Failure Behavior.

### Files to Read — branch mode

- `.pipeline/classification.json` — use `what` field to derive the branch slug.

### Files to Read — commit mode

- `.pipeline/spec-refinement/spec.json` — use `tasks[]` to find the active task's `description` for the commit message.
- `.pipeline/implementation/task-1/impl-write-code-result.json` — use `files_modified[]`. Require `status: "passed"`.
- `.pipeline/implementation/task-1/tests-result.json` — use `test_files[]`. Require `status: "passed"`.
- `.pipeline/implementation/task-1/review-chain-result.json` — require `status: "passed"`. Confirms the review chain approved the code before commit.

For decompose ON, replace `task-1` with the active task id.

### Files to Read — pr mode

- `.pipeline/spec-refinement/spec.json` — use `what`, `user_sees`, `criteria[]`, and `out_of_scope[]` to compose the PR title and body.
- `.pipeline/classification.json` — use the trust/decompose modifier flags, surfaced in the PR body.
- `.pipeline/impl-describe-flow.txt` — trust ON only. Include verbatim in the PR body if present.

## Output Contract

### Result Files

| Mode | Result file |
|------|-------------|
| branch | `.pipeline/implementation/git-branch-result.json` |
| commit | `.pipeline/implementation/task-1/git-commit-result.json` (task id substituted for decompose ON) |
| pr | `.pipeline/git-pr-result.json` |
| invalid `$ARGUMENTS` | `.pipeline/implementation/git-mode-error.json` |

### Result Schema — branch mode

```json
{
  "skill": "git-tool",
  "mode": "branch",
  "status": "created",
  "branch_name": "feature/add-response-action",
  "base": "main",
  "summary": "Branch feature/add-response-action created from main."
}
```

`status` is `created` when the branch was newly created, `exists` when the branch already existed at dispatch time, or `failed` on error.

### Result Schema — commit mode

```json
{
  "skill": "git-tool",
  "mode": "commit",
  "status": "committed",
  "task_id": "task-1",
  "branch_name": "feature/add-response-action",
  "commit_sha": "abcd1234",
  "files_committed": [
    "path/to/changed-file.ts",
    "path/to/test-file.spec.ts"
  ],
  "summary": "Committed task-1: add response action to action items."
}
```

`status` is `committed` on success, or `failed` on error.

### Result Schema — pr mode

```json
{
  "skill": "git-tool",
  "mode": "pr",
  "status": "opened",
  "pr_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123",
  "pr_number": 123,
  "branch_name": "feature/add-response-action",
  "base": "main",
  "summary": "PR #123 opened against main."
}
```

`status` is `opened` on success, or `failed` on error.

### Status Values

Per mode:

- **branch mode** — `created` | `exists` | `failed`
- **commit mode** — `committed` | `failed`
- **pr mode** — `opened` | `failed`

No other status values. Orchestrators route on `status` and never read narrative fields.

## Modifier Behavior

| Modifier | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Standard | All modes as described above. PR body lists criteria and out_of_scope from spec. |
| Trust ON | PR mode inserts `impl-describe-flow.txt` verbatim into the PR body under a "Data Flow" section before the criteria list. |
| Decompose ON | Commit mode uses the active task id from `$ARGUMENTS` to locate result files and compose the commit message. PR mode's body lists tasks in order; the title still comes from `spec.json.what`. |

## Algorithm

### Mode dispatch

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. Extract the first token as `mode`. Extract the second token as `task_id` when present (commit mode only). If `mode` is not one of `branch`, `commit`, `pr`, write `.pipeline/implementation/git-mode-error.json` with `{"skill":"git-tool","status":"failed","summary":"invalid or missing mode argument: <received>"}` and stop. Do NOT ask for clarification. Do NOT attempt to infer the mode from pipeline state.
2. Dispatch to the mode-specific algorithm below.

### Branch mode

1. Run `mkdir -p .pipeline/implementation`. Run `rm -f .pipeline/implementation/git-branch-result.json`.
2. Read `.pipeline/classification.json`. If missing, malformed, or `what` is empty, write `failed` result naming the specific problem, then stop.
3. Derive the branch slug from `classification.json.what`: lowercase, non-alphanumeric → hyphen, collapse consecutive hyphens, trim leading/trailing hyphens, truncate to 50 characters. Prefix with `feature/`. If the resulting slug is empty after trimming, write `failed` and stop.
4. Run `git rev-parse --verify --quiet refs/heads/<branch_name>`. If it returns 0, the branch already exists — check it out with `git checkout <branch_name>`, write `status: "exists"` with the existing branch name, stop.
5. Verify the current working tree is clean: `git status --porcelain`. If output is non-empty, write `failed` with a summary naming the dirty paths, stop.
6. Check out main: `git checkout main`. Pull latest: `git pull --ff-only origin main` — if it fails, write `failed` with the error, stop.
7. Create and check out the branch: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`. If it fails, write `failed` with the error, stop.
8. Write `git-branch-result.json` with `status: "created"`, the branch name, base `main`, and a summary. Stop.

### Commit mode

1. Resolve `task_id` (from `$ARGUMENTS` if present, else `task-1`). Run `mkdir -p .pipeline/implementation/<task_id>`. Run `rm -f .pipeline/implementation/<task_id>/git-commit-result.json`.
2. Read `.pipeline/implementation/<task_id>/impl-write-code-result.json`, `.pipeline/implementation/<task_id>/tests-result.json`, `.pipeline/implementation/<task_id>/review-chain-result.json`, and `.pipeline/spec-refinement/spec.json`. If any is missing or malformed, or if any of the three result files does not have `status: "passed"`, write `failed` result naming the specific problem (which file, what was wrong), then stop.
3. Locate the task in `spec.json.tasks[]` matching `task_id`. If not found, write `failed`, stop.
4. Verify the branch state: `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` must start with `feature/`. If not, write `failed` with the current ref, stop.
5. Assemble the file list as the union of `impl-write-code-result.json.files_modified` and `tests-result.json.test_files`. Stage only those paths: `git add <path>` for each. Do NOT use `git add -A` or `git add .`.
6. Verify staged content matches: `git diff --cached --name-only` must equal the assembled list (same set). If it does not match, write `failed` naming the discrepancy, stop.
7. Compose the commit message. First line: `<task_id>: <task.description>` truncated to 72 characters. Body: a blank line then the list of `criteria_ids` the task covers, one per line as `- <criterion_id>`.
8. Run `git commit` with the composed message passed via HEREDOC. Do NOT pass `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, or `--amend`.
9. If the commit fails (e.g., pre-commit hook), write `failed` with the full hook output in `summary`, stop. Do NOT re-stage. Do NOT retry.
10. Read the new commit SHA: `git rev-parse HEAD`.
11. Write `git-commit-result.json` with `status: "committed"`, the task id, branch name, commit sha, the committed file list, and a summary. Stop.

### PR mode

1. Run `rm -f .pipeline/git-pr-result.json`.
2. Read `.pipeline/spec-refinement/spec.json` and `.pipeline/classification.json`. If either is missing or malformed, write `failed` result naming the specific problem, then stop.
3. Check for `.pipeline/impl-describe-flow.txt`. Load as `describe_flow` if present; otherwise `describe_flow` is none.
4. Verify the branch state: current ref starts with `feature/`. Working tree clean (`git status --porcelain` empty). If either fails, write `failed`, stop.
5. Push the branch: `git push -u origin <branch_name>`. If it fails, write `failed` with the error, stop.
6. Compose the PR title: `spec.json.what` truncated to 70 characters.
7. Compose the PR body as markdown sections in this order:
   - `## Summary` — `spec.json.user_sees` as a paragraph.
   - `## Acceptance Criteria` — bulleted list, one per `criteria[]` entry: `- **<id>** (Given) <given> (When) <when> (Then) <then>`.
   - `## Out of Scope` — bulleted list of `out_of_scope[]` entries.
   - `## Classification` — one line: `trust=<on|off>, decompose=<on|off>` from `classification.json`.
   - `## Data Flow` — included only when `describe_flow` is present. Insert the file's content verbatim.
8. Run `gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "<body>" --base main`. Pass the body via HEREDOC to preserve formatting. Capture stdout.
9. Parse the PR URL from stdout. Extract the PR number from the URL.
10. Write `git-pr-result.json` with `status: "opened"`, PR URL, PR number, branch name, base `main`, and a summary. Stop.

## Anti-Rationalization Rules

- Thinking "I should also stage this untracked file the pipeline didn't mention"? Stop. Commit mode stages exactly the union of `files_modified` and `test_files`. Extra files are scope leaks that bypass the review chain.
- Thinking "the commit failed a pre-commit hook, I'll `--no-verify` and try again"? Stop. Hook failures are real failures. Write `failed` with the hook output. Never pass `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, or `--amend`.
- Thinking "I can fix the small thing the hook complained about and retry"? Stop. Do not modify source files. The hook failure is a signal to escalate — upstream agents produced code the project's hooks rejected.
- Thinking "the branch already exists and is on a different commit — I should reset it"? Stop. Never `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, or delete branches. If the branch is in an unexpected state, write `failed` with the current SHA and stop.
- Thinking "main is ahead and has conflicts — I'll rebase / merge / force-push"? Stop. Branch mode only runs `git pull --ff-only`. If it cannot fast-forward, write `failed` and stop.
- Thinking "the PR body is long — I'll summarize the criteria instead of listing them all"? Stop. Every criterion goes in the body verbatim. The human reads them at the PR gate.
- Thinking "I should amend the last commit to include this small fix"? Stop. `--amend` is forbidden. Each commit is append-only.
- Thinking "no valid mode was passed, I'll infer it from the state of `.pipeline/`"? Stop. Missing or invalid `$ARGUMENTS` is a dispatch error. Write the mode-error result and stop. Do not guess.
- Thinking "the input is ambiguous, I should ask the user what they meant"? Stop. Every input case has deterministic handling: valid → execute; missing/malformed/unknown → write the result file with `status: "failed"` and a summary.
- Thinking "this input is broken, I'll just exit without writing"? Stop. Write the result file with the appropriate failure status before exiting. The orchestrator reads the result file to route.

## Boundary Constraints

- Do not dispatch other agents.
- Read only files declared in the Input Contract for the active mode.
- Write only the mode-specific result file.
- Do not modify source files, test files, or any files outside `.pipeline/`.
- Do not use `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `git checkout --`, `git clean`, `git branch -D`, `git commit --amend`, `--no-verify`, or `--no-gpg-sign`.
- Do not merge PRs. Merge is a human action at the PR review gate.
- Do not close or comment on GitHub issues.
- Use `Bash` for git, `gh`, `rm -f` of the result file, and directory creation. No other shell use.
- Do not pause for human input. Perform the action, write result, exit.
